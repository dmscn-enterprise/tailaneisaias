## How it works?
This project is easily customizable and made to be easy to add/remove links.
You can easily add or remove links using the `links.js` file which is a module that exports an array of objects, each link and its information being inside the properties of that object.

There are three properties:
- **name**: Which is the name that will appear as the title of the link.
- **url**: A url with the link you want to be redirected.
- **color**: Color, which is currently configured in the .css only three ```red, blue, orange```.

```js
export const links = [
  {
    name: 'Instagram',
    url: 'https://yourlink.com/',
    color: 'red'
  },
]
```

To customize with your information I recommend making a clone of the project using:
```bash
git clone <repo-url>
```
